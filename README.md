# Portals in all capitals
SQL script to add portals in every capital.
The portals will be added near every <Portal Trainer>.

Use `portals-in-all-capitals.up.sql` to apply the changes. 
If you'd like to revert them, use `portals-in-all-capitals.down.sql`.

Always check the SQL scripts before executing them in order to avoid ID conflicts.
